# Rules

This can update as we go along

Do not Push straight to main. 
Do not Edit straight to main. 

Always, and always 
- Create your own branch based of Main and edit there
- push to your OWN branch.
- If you want to push to MAIN branch you need a SECOND person approval
-   Create a pull request
-   Use the "Review - Request" and ask someone to review it
-   If both OK's the code and any merge conflict is fixed
-   And the MOST RECENT code from main merged together with your code works on YOUR test branch
-   In case of conflicts, contact the person the conflict arises with and solve the merge.

Cheers :D
